# Dog breed recognition
**Python | C# | Android | TensorFlow**
### Features: 
- The application allows for recognizing the breed of a dog based on a photo.
- The application uses a neural network model with TensorFlow to recognize dog breeds.
- The application allows for taking a photo using the camera.
- The application requires an internet connection to download the model data.
 
### Creating your model: 
- Creating your model requires knowledge of TensorFlow and programming in Python.
- To create your model, you need to download training data on dog breeds and use TensorFlow tools to create a neural network.
- Then, you need to conduct the training process on the training data and evaluate the model using test data.

### Notes: 
- The application uses machine learning models to recognize dog breeds based on photos.
- The results may be imprecise if the photo is of low quality or does not clearly show the dog.
- The model may also have difficulty recognizing rarely seen or hybrid breeds.
- The application requires an internet connection to download the latest model data.
- The application is not intended for professional use and is only an entertainment tool.
- The application cannot replace the opinion of a veterinarian or a dog breed specialist.
