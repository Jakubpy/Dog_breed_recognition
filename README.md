# Dog breed recognition

<h2>Languages and Tools:</h2>
Python | C# | Android | TensorFlow <br><br>
The project was carried out in a group of 2 people. Our goal was to train the network with TensorFlow and build a database of 120 dog breeds. 
Then we built a Rest API connected to the application on the phone. The way how it works is: a picture is sent to the computer and checked with the database. 
When the breed matches, the response goes to the phone and gives to the user the result.
